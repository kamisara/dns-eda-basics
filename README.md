# DNS Query Logs - Basic Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains a foundational exploratory data analysis (EDA) of DNS query logs from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) dataset.

## 📊 About This Project

This is a **basic EDA project** created for a workshop assignment. It demonstrates fundamental data analysis techniques including:

- Data loading and initial inspection
- Missing value analysis
- Temporal pattern exploration
- Basic statistical summaries
- Data visualization fundamentals

## 📁 Files

- `dns_eda_basics.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
- `visualizations/` - Generated plots and charts (if included)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
- NumPy for numerical operations

## 📚 Dataset

The data comes from the [LANL Cyber Security Research Dataset](https://csr.lanl.gov/data/cyber1/), a publicly available collection of DNS query logs from an enterprise network.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as a **learning exercise** to practice core EDA techniques. It covers the essential steps of understanding a dataset before any advanced modeling or analysis.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- How to handle large datasets with sampling
- Basic temporal pattern recognition
- Simple statistical summaries
- Fundamental data visualization techniques
