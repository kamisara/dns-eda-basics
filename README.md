# DNS Query Logs - Basic Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains a foundational exploratory data analysis (EDA) of DNS query logs from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) dataset.

## 📊 About This Project

This is a **basic EDA project** created for a workshop assignment. It demonstrates fundamental data analysis techniques including:

- Data loading and initial inspection
- Missing value analysis
- Temporal pattern exploration
- Basic statistical summaries
- Data visualization fundamentals
